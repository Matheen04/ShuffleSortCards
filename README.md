# ShuffleSortCards
This repo is for the cards UI where user can sort and shuffle the set of cards

We can run this application by opening the Cards.html file in chrome or any other browser

We assumed that the cards max limit is 9 which is defined as constant in JS file

The UI has been designed responsive assuming the mobile width is 375px and rest belongs to ipad or desktop screen

This UI is designed using simple HTML, CSS and JS. No frameworks or libraries are used.
